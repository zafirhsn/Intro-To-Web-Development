			//My basic idea was to have the user select a city from the HTML form then take their response and create a GET HTTP to a weather API. Then, I parse the JSON file for the weather like "sunny" or "cloudy" etc. I then update the HTML and upload a picture of the corresponding weather. I know we haven't focused on the backend stuff in this class, but I was interested in GET requests and JSON files. This was much harder than I thought and I didn't get past receiving the JSON file and the html form data as a string. I didn't figure out how to parse either.


			function submitWeather() {
				var input = $("form").serialize();

				//Need to parse the string for the city name and add it on to URL 
				//of GET request to weather API
			}
	
			var weatherJSON = $.get("http://api.wunderground.com/api/82b6cd80a08334b5/conditions/q/MA/Boston.json", "json");

			//Now I need to parse the JSON file for the weather value
			//No idea how to do this
			//Once I get the weather value, use if statements to determine what picture to upload to site


			console.log(weatherJSON.getResponseHeader);
			console.log(weatherJSON);
